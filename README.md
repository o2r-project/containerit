`containerit` packages R script/session/workspace and all dependencies
as a [Docker](https://docker.com/) container by automagically generating
a suitable `Dockerfile`. The package’s website is
<https://o2r.info/containerit/>.

## Prerequisites

-   `containerit` only fully works if you have
    [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) installed
    and is only tested with [Docker Engine -
    Community](https://docs.docker.com/install/overview/) (previously
    called Docker Community Edition or Docker CE).
-   `R (>= 3.5.0)` is needed so that some dependencies
    (e.g. BiocManager) are available; older versions of R predate the
    development of the package and were never tested.

## Quick start

### Try out `containerit` in a container

You can spin up a Docker container with `containerit` pre-installed if
you want to try out the package. The default of the [`containerit`
images on Docker Hub](#images) is to start plain R, but you can also
start an with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
session in a browser.

**Note**: The `geospatial` variant is used so that examples from
`containerit` vignettes are likely to work. For a minimal `Dockerfile`
to run `containerit`, see `inst/docker/minimal/Dockerfile`.

``` bash
docker run --rm -it -e PASSWORD=o2r -p 8787:8787 o2rproject/containerit:geospatial /init
```

Now go to <http://localhost:8787> and log in with the user `rstudio` and
password `o2r`. Continue in section [Use](#use).

### Install

Installation is only possible from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("o2r-project/containerit")
```

### Use

`containerit` can create `Dockerfile` objects in R and render them as
`Dockerfile` instructions based on session information objects or
runnable R files (`.R`, `.Rmd`).

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("containerit"))
my_dockerfile <- containerit::dockerfile(from = utils::sessionInfo())
#> INFO [2021-10-11 18:45:46] Created Dockerfile-Object based on sessionInfo
```

``` r
print(my_dockerfile)
#> FROM rocker/r-ver:4.1.0
#> LABEL maintainer="jupyter"
#> WORKDIR /payload/
#> CMD ["R"]
```

You can disable logging:

``` r
futile.logger::flog.threshold(futile.logger::ERROR)
```

Now we create a Dockerfile for a specific R version and a given R
Markdown file. The option `filter_baseimage_pkgs` is used to not add any
packages already available in the base image, which can save a lot of
build time.

``` r
rmd_dockerfile <- containerit::dockerfile(from = "inst/demo.Rmd",
                                          image = "rocker/verse:3.5.2",
                                          maintainer = "o2r",
                                          filter_baseimage_pkgs = TRUE)
#> Detected API version '1.40' is above max version '1.39'; downgrading
#> Detected API version '1.40' is above max version '1.39'; downgrading
print(rmd_dockerfile)
#> FROM rocker/verse:3.5.2
#> LABEL maintainer="o2r"
#> # CRAN packages skipped because they are in the base image: knitr
#> RUN ["install2.r", "fortunes"]
#> WORKDIR /payload/
#> CMD ["R"]
```

For extended instructions, see the vignettes at in the directory
`vignettes/`, which are readable online at
<https://o2r.info/containerit/articles/>.

## Images

Images are available starting from different base images. All images are
also available with version tags.

The `Dockerfile`s are available in the directory
`inst/docker/Dockerfile`.

### verse

``` bash
docker inspect o2rproject/containerit
```

Base image: `rocker/verse:4.0.5`

```

## RStudio Add-in

[RStudio Addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) allow to
create interactive user interfaces for the RStudio development
environment. Courtesy of a great contribution by a [group of
enthusiasts](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit/issues/27#issuecomment-440869329)
at the [ROpenSci OZ Unconference
2018](https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/), there are several forms to
quickly create `Dockefile`s from different use cases, e.g. the current
session, a vector of expressions, or a script file.

## Contribute

All help is welcome: asking questions, providing documentation, testing,
or even development.

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of
Conduct](CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to
abide by its terms.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Development

[r-hub builder](https://builder.r-hub.io/) is great for running checks,
e.g. before submitting to CRAN and on other operating systems.

``` r
library("rhub")
rhub::check_for_cran()
rhub::check_on_windows()
```

You can build the [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) site with

``` r
pkgdown::build_site()
```

You can build the Docker images locally with the current development
version using the following commands.

``` bash
docker build --tag containerit:dev --file inst/docker/Dockerfile.local .
docker build --tag containerit:geospatial-dev --file inst/docker/geospatial/Dockerfile.local .
```

You can use [`pre-commit`
hooks](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/pre-commit-hooks) to avoid some
mistakes.

A [codemeta](https://codemeta.github.io/) file, `codemeta.json`, with
metadata about the package and its dependencies is generated
automatically when this document is compiled.

``` r
codemetar::write_codemeta(".")
#> Added codemeta.json to .Rbuildignore
#> codemetar has the highest opinion of this R package :-)
```
